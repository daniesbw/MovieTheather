Cinema Ticket Booking App
=========================

Welcome to my first React project - a Cinema Ticket Booking application! This project is a simulation of a cinema environment where users can browse movie listings, select showtimes, and purchase tickets, all from the comfort of their home.

Description
-----------

The Cinema Ticket Booking App provides a user-friendly interface for movie enthusiasts to explore current movies, view detailed information about each film, select showtimes, and securely purchase tickets. Built with React, this application aims to deliver a seamless and interactive user experience similar to what you would find on professional cinema booking websites.

Features
--------

*   **Movie Listings**: Browse through a list of currently showing movies with posters, ratings, and genres.
*   **Showtime Selection**: Choose your preferred showtime for each movie.
*   **Ticket Booking**: Securely book your tickets with an option to select seats (if applicable).
*   **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.

Getting Started
---------------

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
*   npm (Node Package Manager), which comes with Node.js

You can check if you have Node.js and npm installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

Copy code

`node -v npm -v`

### Installation

#### Setting Up the Frontend

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
    
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cd your-repo-name`
    
3.  Install NPM packages for the React app:
    
    Copy code
    
    `npm install`
    

#### Setting Up the Backend Server

1.  Navigate to the `server` folder within the project directory:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cd server`
    
2.  Install NPM packages for the server:
    
    Copy code
    
    `npm install`
    

### Running the Application

#### Starting the Backend Server

While in the `server` directory, start the Node.js server by running:

sqlCopy code

`npm start`

This command will start the backend server, typically listening on `http://localhost:30001/` or another port specified in your server configuration.

#### Starting the Frontend React App

Open a new terminal window or tab, navigate back to the root project directory, and start the React development server:

bashCopy code

`cd .. npm start`

The React app should now be running and accessible on `http://localhost:3000/`.
